# Gin Bootstrap Initializer

Generates a simple skeleton directory structure for go/gin/bootstrap web apps

## Description

This package handles building a common and basic web project layout to allow the developer to 
focus on the code, not the directory structure.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* None! Only standard library functions were used in this project.

### Installing
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/anthony-hopkins/gin-bootstrap-init
  cd ./gin-boostrap-init
  go build ./src/ginWebInit
```

### Executing program

* Super simple. Just run the compiled binary from above and pass an app name as a parameter.
* Being that the binary is portable it can be moved to any directory you need to 
execute it in. You can also add the binary to your system path if used a lot.
```bash
./goWebInit.exe appName
```
